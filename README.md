# React Gallery Exam

## Instructions
Welcome to the React Gallery Code Exam! üëæ

In the following three hours you'll be evaluated for your coding skills in solving a nine-step challenge building the logic layer of an image gallery. In each step you will get the instructions that will lead you to the next step. After completing a step, take the time to refactor your code so it will be clean & organized before moving on.

### Getting Started

* In the project directory run `npm start` and wait for the Gallery page to open in Chrome
* The Gallery page is split to two parts:
  * **Left side** - task instructions & progress
  * **Right side** - the visual gallery

* The red task marks the current task (the current step that its tests are failing). Complete the task instructions by modifying the files in the `src/gallery` directory. Every time that you save changes to the files the tasks will re-run and evaluate your solution (using HMR). Once a task's tests are passing it will appear green, and the next task will be displayed in red.

* **Notice:** if at some point you will break the logic in a way that causes a previous test to fail - you will return to that failing step.
* The tests run in the browser along with your code, hence you can debug them (the tests files are named `test00x.js` where `x` is the step number).
* The current task includes the first failing test at the bottom of the description.
* If at any point something is unclear you may contact your interviewer.
* Solving the bonus questions is optional and it requires ReactJS knowledge
* Good luck! ‚úåÔ∏è
